            <title>What is Podcasting?</title>
            <description>What is Podcasting&lt;br /&gt;
Podcasting is quickly becoming a buzz word among the techie crowd. So what is podcasting, anyway? Podcasting is online audio content that is delivered via an RSS feed. Many people liken podcasting to radio on demand. However, in reality, podcasting gives far more options in terms of content and programming than radio does. In addition, with Podcasting, listeners can determine the time and the place, meaning they decide what programming they want to receive and when they want to listen to it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Listeners can retain audio archives to listen to at their leisure. While blogs have turned many bloggers into journalists, podcasting has the potential to turn podcasters into radio personalities. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting Is Used</title>
            <description>Although podcasting is new, it is well on its way to becoming a mainstream communication medium. Podcasting, simply put, is audio files that are delivered via RSS. Many people believe that podcasting is solely for the distribution of music files, but really, nothing could be further from the truth. This emerging method of audio file distribution has opened an array of marketing and communication opportunities to businesses. Currently, most who are familiar with podcasting are technically savvy, but it is clear that podcasting will be more than a passing fad as many businesses are adopting podcasting and employing it in unusual yet powerful ways. Podcasting can be used for talk shows, tutorials, music demos, educational training, stories, comedy clips, debates or even foreign language tutorials.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Understanding RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS also known as rich site summary or real simply syndication, arrived on the scene a number of years ago, but was only recently embraced by webmasters as a means to effectively syndicate content. RSS Feeds provide webmasters and content providers an avenue to provide concise summaries to prospective readers. Thousands of commercial web sites and blogs now publish content summaries in an RSS feed. Each item in the feed typically contains a headline; article summary and link back to the online article.&lt;br /&gt;

The filters can be defined by the publisher so that the resulting RSS feed contains only the information they want.

            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;

Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling.

            <title>Questioning Credibility Online</title>
            <description>Credibility online is becoming more and more of an issue. Anyone can have a blog or post to a forum and anyone can edit wiki entries. Web surfers are beginning to comprehend that just because it is in print does not necessarily mean that it is true. In fact, in today&apos;s online world, the collective truth might be the closest thing we can get to the real truth. Peer policing and social bookmarking have become common in the online world. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting Works</title>
            <description>It has been said that in October of 2004 a Google search returned less than 6,000 results for the term &lt;i&gt;podcasting&lt;/i&gt;. Today, a similar search yields more than 857,000 results. Like the blogging phenomenon, podcasting has come out of nowhere and attracted an enthusiastic following.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Sermons</title>
            <description>The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances. Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders that communities have become accustom to.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Deconstructing RSS</title>
            <description>Selecting and utilizing appropriate keywords is a critical step in Web design. If your Web site and meta tags do not contain related keywords, web surfers will be unable to find you through search engines, which use keywords to index sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The formula is a little tricky — you will need to locate terms that are popular and relevant to your site. These terms may or may not be terms that you feel are relevant terms. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers of Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. &lt;br /&gt;

Podcasting is a great new medium, but creating a podcast is only half of the work. Promoting a podcast is equally critical to it's success. <br />

            <title>Really Simple Success</title>
            <description>In search engine optimization, great content increases the likelihood of your website receiving and maintaining a high search engine rank, which ultimately drives qualified traffic and leads to your company&apos;s website. But great content requires great distribution to really shine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Placing your content in front of the right customers at the right time is critical, especially when your customers and prospects have so many choices online for learning about the exact same products and services you sell. While there are many ways to drive traffic to your website, one of the more successful methods--syndication--also happens to be one of the most cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;

<b>Podcasts and Copyrights</b><br />
Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a means of creating an RSS feed, be it through software or manual work. As a result, just about anyone can podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can't even be heard clearly. For this reason, copyright infringement leeches, often unwittingly, into a number of podcasts. To produce a successful podcast, it is important to understand and respect Western copyright laws. To help ensure that these things are done, we have compiled some information about podcasts, music, and copyright law. <br />

<b>Why Over Sharing Might Be Hurting You</b><br />
We all know someone who divulges a little too much information on the Internet. Whether it's the friend who Instagrams every meal or the relative who constantly posts updates on how Fido's doing, this phenomenon seems well on its way to pervading all the social media we use. Maybe you have even caught yourself posting a bit too much. While something that everyone seems to be doing may appear harmless enough, oversharing can have some negative consequences of which all social media users should take note. <br />

<b>Crowdsourcing and Social Media: Their Real Impact </b><br />
It seems that our society is growing ever more dependent on social media; more and more people are joining social networking giants such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and more such websites and applications are springing up to meet the rising demand for them. As society and culture continue this turn towards technology, so do the operations of society, especially through crowdsourcing. <br />

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Influence of Technology on Politics</title>
            <description>The staggering distribution numbers, through channels like iTunes, YouTube, or podcasting websites, indicate that technology could play a critical role in the upcoming elections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can, and will, the next generation of politicians exploit the communication mediums available to them? Will the new communication mediums have the power to influence public opinion? Will politicians be the victims of technology, or will they use it to their benefit? Will one party benefit from the use of the technology more than another? All reasonable questions, considering the role technology plays in todays society. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Questioning Online Credibility</title>
            <description>Credibility online is becoming more and more of an issue. Anyone can have a blog or post to a forum and anyone can edit wiki entries. Web surfers are beginning to comprehend that just because it is in print does not necessarily mean that it is true. In fact, in today&apos;s online world, the collective truth might be the closest thing we can get to the real truth. Peer policing and social bookmarking have become common in the online world. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What RSS is Not...</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[It is difficult to have a conversation about technology these days that does not involve RSS. In the age of the Internet, communication is expected to be instantaneous. RSS offers instant real-time distribution in an on demand world. <br />
<br />
<b>What is RSS? </b><br />
RSS is a standard format for syndicating information or content over the Internet. Once a visitor subscribes to an RSS feed, they receive the new information each time the feed is updated. <br />
<br />
<b>RSS Does Not Equal Email</b><br />
RSS is not email, nor is it designed to be a replacement for email. RSS is a supplemental communication channel that can be used to deliver content.<br />

            <title>Set Your Podcast Up for Success</title>
            <description>Podcasting Tips &lt;br /&gt;
As podcasts increase in popularity, listeners have more choices. So while you might be ahead of the competition, you should still be thinking about ways that you can make your podcast unique and stand out from similarly themed podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Plan Accordingly. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When making the decision and commitment to podcast, it is important to think beyond the moment. Before starting, think about the time the podcast production will take. How will podcasting fit into a current schedule? How frequently will you podcast? &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Personal Namespace Extension</title>
            <description>Extension: Personal Namespace Extension&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Purpose: The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements (tags) in any RSS feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasts and Copyrights</title>
            <description>Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a means of creating an RSS feed, be it through software or manual work. As a result, just about anyone can podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can not even be heard clearly.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Consumer education is something many small software companies tend to overlook. While the benefits of consumer education may not always be obvious, the fact of the matter is that educated customers are good customers, and happier customers. A customer who does not understand an application&apos;s capabilities or features is more likely to experience frustration with it, making them less satisfied with your product and also potentially draining your support time. Therefore, we&apos;ve created a brief guide to consumer education to help you enhance your business.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Sound Effects the Power of Audio</title>
            <description>Most podcasters and producers do not have the time or equipment to go out and record all the sound effects they may want to incorporate into their production. Podcasters are better off using royalty-free sound effects. Royalty-free sound effects are purchased, and there is no recurring fee for the use of the effect. The purchaser may use the sound effect(s) as often as required within the license terms and conditions, without paying for the use of the sound effect each time the effect is used. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Podcasts are relatively inexpensive to create, as a result, and the quality in published podcasts is extremely diverse.

            <title>RSS Feed Etiquette</title>
            <description>Citizen journalists and writers have become common place on the web. Perhaps you are considering blogging, but are unsure of how to enter the world of online journaling. As the medium has grown, I thought it might be a good idea to put together some general guidelines for new bloggers and reminders to veteran bloggers about blogging practices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no Emily Post in blogging that offers etiquette advice, or a Miss Manners that details appropriate behavior. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Create a Personal Namespace</title>
            <description>The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements tags in any RSS feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Do I Promote My Podcast?</title>
            <description>There are a variety of things you can do to promote your podcast and increase its popularity... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Auto-Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Include auto-discovery tags in the HTML header of the web page. Some podcasting and RSS readers will automatically detect that an RSS feed or podcast is available if such auto-discovery tags are included in the web page header tags. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Crowd Sourcing and Social Media</title>
            <description>It seems that our society is growing ever more dependent on social media; more and more people are joining social networking giants such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and more such websites and applications are springing up to meet the rising demand for them. As society and culture continue this turn towards technology, so do the operations of society, especially through crowdsourcing. A powerful tool, crowdsourcing does much good, but has also caused a number of problems. In such a situation, one must ask: do the benefits of crowdsourcing really outweigh the risks.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS News You Choose</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<b>Why is RSS So Magical?</b><br />
The answer is simple: RSS is news you choose. <br />
<br />
<b>How Does it Work?</b><br />
Publishers and webmasters provide content and news in an RSS feed. Users view the content of interest in an RSS reader or news aggregator. The aggregator or reader contains the collection of feeds that are of interest to the user. As the RSS feed is updated the content in the reader or aggregator updates with the new information. At any point, users can remove a feed from their aggregator or reader and no longer receive information from that source. Ultimately, the user is choosing the news and content they wish to view.<br />

<b>Working From Home </b><br />
Developments in technology have made it possible, if not easy, for small businesses and employees to telecommute.

<b>Develop Content Worth Linking To </b><br />
All webmasters have heard the adage, <i>content is king</i>. However, the struggle to discern what types of content to develop is one that webmasters have yet to conquer. If you are familiar with this dilemma, you should know that Google's latest algorithm changes cause Google to assess how visitors interact with a website. This data from a visitor's experience is now used in organic search ranking. Therefore, you must create content that visitors will not only click on, but that they will spend time reading and even return to. For content development success, develop content not only worth linking to, but worth spending time on! <br />

            <title>How Podcasting is Used</title>
            <description>Although podcasting is new, it is well on its way to becoming a mainstream communication medium. Podcasting, simply put, is audio files that are delivered via RSS. Many people believe that podcasting is solely for the distribution of music files, but really, nothing could be further from the truth. This emerging method of audio file distribution has opened an array of marketing and communication opportunities to businesses. Currently, most who are familiar with podcasting are technically savvy, but it is clear that podcasting will be more than a passing fad as many businesses are adopting podcasting and employing it in unusual yet powerful ways. Podcasting can be used for talk shows, tutorials, music demos, educational training, stories, comedy clips, debates or even foreign language tutorials. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often synchronized with certain actions, such as a door&apos;s slamming being accompanied by the appropriate noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other emotions.&lt;br /&gt;

Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often synchronized with certain actions, such as a doors slamming being accompanied by the appropriate noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other emotions.&lt;br /&gt;

As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Females, in particular, should be cautious when circumnavigating the blogosphere. If you are a blogger or contemplating an online journal, consider these tips to protecting your identity: &lt;br /&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedforall.com/sql2rss.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;SQL2RSS&lt;/a&gt; script allows you to easily create rss feeds from SQL databases. The script currently supports the conversion of MySQL databases to RSS feeds. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When using SQL2RSS the publisher has complete control over the content in the resulting RSS feed. Administrators and publishers control the database query which allows them the flexibility to determine what data is inserted into the RSS feeds from the database.</description>

            <title>Podcast Sermons</title>
            <description>The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances. Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders that communities have become accustom to. Using technology as a communication medium has not been lost on spiritual leaders and many have embraced the Internet as a medium to spread their faith. It is rare to find a house of worship that does not have a website or Internet presense. Expanding upon this theme, parishes looked to podcasting to further expanded the reach of their spiritual counselors and ministers. Many preachers record homilies, hymns, services, sermons or gospel teachings, for parishioners and interested listeners.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Personal RSS Feed Namespaces</title>
            <description>The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements tags in any RSS feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Audio Recording Tips</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Before you begin podcasting develop a plan and a format for your show. Determine the focus of your podcast and what types of guests you would like to interview. Time spent planning your show will contribute to its success.<br />
<b></b><br />
<b>Location, Location, Location</b><br />
When you are producing a podcast on a regular basis it is important that you select an appropriate location for the recording to take place. The location should be free of external distractions and relatively quiet. It is easiest if you use the same location each time, that way the equipment can remain in place and will not require moving or setup each time you produce a show.<br />

            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;

Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

                <![CDATA[Consider following these simple podcasting tips to get the most from your podcast and make it stand out from other podcasts in the crowd. <br />
<br />
<b>DO</b><br />
<b>1. Make it Professional </b><br />
Regardless of whether you are podcasting from your garage or a corporate boardroom there is no reason that your podcast cannot have a professional sound and feel. Use software to edit the audio file and filter background noise. Listeners will not tolerate poor audio quality. With the wide range of relatively inexpensive software and hardware available there is no reason you can not provide good quality audio podcast. <br />

            <title>The Dangers of Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Publicize Your RSS Feed</title>
            <description>There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you&apos;ve made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt; 1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile. A number of RSS search engines and RSS directories exist that allow you to freely submit RSS feeds. Feeds are generally categorized and grouped together by subject. Web surfers looking for RSS feeds about a specific subject will often search the RSS directories, to locate a feed that matches their specific criteria. Topic specific RSS feed and podcasting directories are also emerging. Choose a web feed&apos;s category carefully and only submit relevant feeds to topic specific directories.&lt;br /&gt;

Many webmasters wrestle not only with choosing the best domain name, but also with the decision of what domain extensions to select for their website. The following is a general guide to what the most popular domain extensions represent...<br />
<br />
.com - commercial (by far, the most popular domain extension)<br />
.net - network host (often used by hosting companies)<br />

.org - organization<br />
.info - informational sites<br />

            <title>Website Spidering</title>
            <description>Website Spidering refers to the automated process of indexing a web site by a search engine. An automated program, known as a web crawler or spider, will go through a website following the links on each page, and will gather pertinent information from each page until it has properly indexed the entire website.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>2011 Reflections, 2012 Predictions</title>
            <description>No country suffered more than Japan in 2011. Japan was rocked by an 8.9 earthquake, then a tsunami that was created from the quake hit the small island. The tsunami caused significant damage to one of Japans power plants making it impossible to properly cool or shutdown the nuclear reactor. The inability to cool the nuclear plant resulted in a nuclear melt down, and the escape of radiation. When the trifecta hit, the Japanese people earned the world&apos;s respect, they managed the tragedy with stoicism and grace. The consequences of this horrible tragedy, and implications of the radiation leaks, into the sea and atmosphere are still unknown. Japan will bear the scars from 2011, for generations to come.&lt;br /&gt;

                <![CDATA[<b>What is Hot and What is Not in Technology for 2012</b><br />
<br />
<b>1. Mushroom Cloud</b><br />
<br />
The virtual cloud is now a mushroom cloud. More and more applications and data is available virtually. Customers are no longer tied to their desktops, data is accessible in the cloud. As long as you have an Internet connection, you have access, regardless of your hardware.<br />
<b></b><br />
<b>2. Smart Mobility</b><br />
<br />
Mobile phones have become smart devices, they are more than just phones and alarm clocks. By the end of 2012, it will be hard to find a phone that does not run games, support Internet connections and have built in web browser.<br />
<b></b><br />
<b>3. Multi-Function Devices</b><br />
<br />
I suspect that devices will begin merging, there is no longer a need for so many gadgets. The functionality of the devices from smart phones, kindles, ipads and computers are redundant and there is likely to be device consolidation as the overlap in functionality increases. <br />

            <description>The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances. Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Audio File Optimization Tips</title>
            <description>Optimize your audio files to increase their popularity, just as you would optimize a website. Audio search engines are becoming more advanced as audio files become more commonplace on the Internet. Here are some tips to optimize your audio offerings...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Optimize Landing Page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Create a landing page for the audio files. The landing page should explain the audio content and encourage subscriptions. Outline the steps the visitor should take in order to subscribe or listen to the audio file. Make an effort to interact with the visitor on the landing page, and make it as easy as possible for them to subscribe or listen to your podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
            <description>Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to its full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website&apos;s ranking in the search engines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Host Your Own Blog&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Power of Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be podcasts, videos, or other audio/visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find on the web without properly licensing it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Dangers of Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Podcast Tips to a Great Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Realtors Use RSS to Sell Homes</title>
            <description>Daily more and more realtors are turning to RSS as a tool to market homes for sale. The growing RSS phenomenon in the realty market makes perfect sense. Unlike email RSS feeds have a 100% delivery rate. In addition the costs involved in creating and managing an RSS feed are insignificant when compared to the print advertising Realtors spend on each week. Imagine the amount spent each week to promote various properties in circulars and weekly newspapers, compared to the costs associated with updating and managing an RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<b>1.) Title</b> - The title should really be no longer than 10-12 words. Use the title as a headline to attract interest.<br />
<br />
<b>2.) Description</b> - Descriptions are generally summaries, provide additional information to entice the reader to click through for the full information if it is a topic that is of interest to them. Provide enough teaser copy that they can easily discern if its something that is important to them. <br />

            <title>RSS Extensions</title>
            <description>One of the benefits to the RSS 2.0 specification is it&apos;s expandability. RSS 2.0 extensions are often called namespaces. Namespaces allow for users or companies to create new tags or elements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The RSS 2.0 specification goes into detail about how namespaces can be documented to prevent confusion and overlap. The extendibility of the specifications allow a number of industries to use the standard and enhance it, with their specific needs without causing undue confusion or problems, with the original specification. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Technology Has Spawned Industries</title>
            <description>The technical search giant, Google, alone is the inspiration and sole cause behind the creation of thousands of new businesses. There are now companies dedicated solely to Pay-Per-Click campaign management. Thousands of individuals and companies now make money through search engine optimization and outsourcing their services to improve website rankings, specifically to see that a website ranks well in Googles organic search results. There are now software applications that can determine what keywords to use in optimizing a website for search engine rankings, and other software programs that assess and evaluate website traffic and popularity. These products and businesses were all brought to fruition as a result of Googles Internet search domination and technical stature.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>ABCs of RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Implementing RSS (Really Simple Syndication) can be aided by an understanding of the terms relating to RSS. Learn the ABCs of RSS....<br />
<br />
<b>A - AutoDiscovery</b><br />
<br />
Auto Discovery is code that is inserted into the header of an HTML web page, which then indicates to readers that an RSS feed is available for the content.<br />
<br />
<b>B - Blogs</b><br />
<br />
Blogs are web logs that are updated regularly, usually on a daily basis. Blogs generally contain information related to a specific topic. In some cases, blogs are used as daily diaries about people's personal lives, political views, or even as social commentaries. The truth of the matter is that blogs can be shaped into whatever the author wants them to be. While initially thought of as diaries or online journals, blogs have evolved into the latest fresh web content. <br />

            <description>Well, technically they are called &lt;i&gt;XML Namespaces,&lt;/i&gt; but we will call them&lt;i&gt; &apos;RSS Extensions&apos;&lt;/i&gt;, or just &lt;i&gt;Extensions,&lt;/i&gt; in most of this document, mainly because we will be talking about how namespaces specifically apply to RSS feeds, and extends their capabilities. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Subscribe to an RSS Feed</title>
            <description>There are generally two different kinds of tools that allow visitors to subscribe to RSS feeds. These tools are known as aggregators, or RSS news readers. As the content of an RSS feed changes, the RSS reader or aggregator will update itself automatically and display the new RSS feed items. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Emotion of Color in Web Design</title>
            <description>Color psychology is a phrase used to describe the effect that &lt;i&gt;color &lt;/i&gt;has on human behavior. The psychology of color is certainly not a new concept. In fact, it has been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Colors tend to carry non-verbal and subliminal messages, and the color spectrum evokes different emotions and physiological responses in people. The reactions people have to specific colors may be influenced by many factors, including their culture, location, gender, or even their age. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Link Gold</title>
            <description>Links are the threads that bind the web together. The Internet &lt;i&gt;web&lt;/i&gt; is not so different from an actual spider web. Each page on the Internet is connected by an intricate system of links which connect websites to other websites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order for a website to perform well in search engine rankings, it must have connections to other websites through links. These connections or links not only help search engines locate new content as it becomes available, but they also weave together networks of websites that are all related. The number and strength of connections that a website has will help determine the importance of that website. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS2HTML.com is Shut Down</title>
            <description>Unfortunately due to a handful of individuals using the RSS2HTML.com service and distributing malware in their feeds, the site was flagged by Google. As a result we had to discontinue the free rss2html.com service. We highly recommend you download the RSS2HTML script and run it locally so that the interruption will not effect your feeds from displaying. The free RSS2HTML script can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedforall.com/free-php-script.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;http://www.feedforall.com/free-php-script.htm&lt;/a&gt;</description>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[Many webmasters repeat the mistakes made by their predecessors. Take a look at these Top 10 most common web design sins. Have you fallen victim to any of these?<br />
<br />
<b>Sin #1 - Using Techie-Speak</b><br />
<br />
Many websites fail to communicate in terms that website visitors can understand. Set the technical jargon aside, and use simple language and words that will be easy for your audience to understand. Web copy should be written in simple terms. Also, keep in mind that the Internet audience is global, and using language that is more common and easy to comprehend will often expand your reach, even to include non-native speakers.<br />
<br />
<b>Sin #2 - Poor Navigation</b><br />
<br />
Many webmasters fail to provide visitors clear and consistent navigation. Visitors will quickly become frustrated if they cannot easily find the information they are looking for.<br />

            <title>2009 Recap, 2010 Predictions</title>
            <description>Another year has rolled by marked by miracles, political milestones and tragedies alike. 2009 was the year of financial uproar with bailouts and ponzi schemes dominating the news on a regular basis. Chrysler and GM stalwart car giants struggled to survive. Bernie Madoffs financial pyramid came tumbling down, taking average citizen&apos;s retirement plans with it, emptying the coffers of trusting non-profits and celebrities alike.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The United States democratically dominated political landscape juggled health care reform, accusations of death boards, raucous town hall meetings and tea parties from coast to coast. The Swine Flu was quickly renamed H1N1 so that the pork industry would not suffer, and the politicized name change did little to calm pandemic worries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2009 was also marred by a number of notable deaths. Farrah Fawcett, the charming Charlies Angel, battle with cancer came to an end. The controversial but talented Michael Jackson succumbed to what appeared to be a fatal drug cocktail. Eunice Kennedy Shriver, known for the creation of the Special Olympics, passed on. Ted Kennedy, the patriarch of the Kennedy clan, and another controversial and historic figure, succumbed in his battle against a brain tumor. Walter Cronkite, the most trusted voice in America, died, bringing about the end of an era in journalism. Patrick Swayze who danced his way into our hearts, left us with nothing but sadness over his untimely death. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Follow us at &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/feedforall&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;@FeedForAll&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Businesses can use Twitter as a marketing tool in a variety of ways. Many business owners struggle with social media as a marketing medium. At the heart of the most effective social media marketing campaigns is personal communication. Many businesses that try to manage social media may attempt to shout their message, rather than simply engaging with potential customers. Potential customers who are active in social networks will not be receptive to marketing in this fashion. The trick with social media like Twitter is to interact and engage, rather than shouting your message.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Google More Than Just a Search Engine</title>
            <description>The architects of the most powerful search engine in the world have included some really handy algorithms in their service, which allow searchers to quickly locate particular and specific types of information...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Definitions&lt;br /&gt;
In order to quickly find the definition of a word, simply type &quot;define: word&quot; in the search box. Google will then provide the definition of the word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. Area Codes&lt;br /&gt;
Enter a US telephone area code in the URL box to see a map of the area covered by that telephone area code. &lt;br /&gt;

<b>Sound Effects: The Power of Audio</b><br />
Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be podcasts, videos, or other audio visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find on the web without properly licensing it.<br />

            <title>Green Business Tips</title>
            <description>Businesses that are &lt;i&gt;going green &lt;/i&gt;are becoming more and more commonplace. Regardless of your political beliefs or opinions regarding the &lt;i&gt;global warming &lt;/i&gt;concept, few can argue that being environmentally aware will leave the world a better place. Whether a company is simply jumping on the green bandwagon, or are honestly sensitive about environmental issues is really irrelevant. Consumers like green businesses, and shaping your business to promote being &quot;eco-friendly&quot; makes sense from a public relations standpoint. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Search Engine Optimization for PDFs</title>
            <description>Google, Yahoo, and MSN can all spider and index text-based PDF files, and generally they rank quite well. PDF files can be used to seize top listings for important keywords and keyword phrases. In order to have a PDF effectively rank well in organic searches, it should be optimized for the search engines, just as you would optimize a web page. Optimization of PDF files for search engines is very similar to search engine optimization for other types of content... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Re-Using Content</title>
            <description>Repurposing content is not a terribly new concept. Webmasters that picked up on the trend have benefited from traffic surges for a while now. Repurposing content is all about presenting the same content in a variety of different ways, or using different mediums to present the same content. Webmasters can manipulate content in order to provide the same content in any number of different formats. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Businesses Going Green</title>
            <description>We have been making an effort to Go Green, thought this might help some of our customers:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A business that makes the decision to be environmentally-conscious will often promote goodwill among potential customers, while making the world a better place for future generations. Many businesses hesitate to adopt green practices because they fear it will hurt their bottom line and negatively impact profits. But many eco-conscious businesses discover that they can actually save money and bring in new customers who specifically patronize companies that actively make an effort to be environmentally friendly. Many customers may even be willing to pay a bit more for a product or service from a company that is green.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many businesses already do things that are eco-friendly, not necessarily because they are sensitive to green living, but simply to save money. That does not, however, diminish the value of their green efforts. The trick for businesses is to be eco-friendly without compromising profitability.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Where to Find Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Royalty-free sound effect libraries contain thousands of sound effects that can be licensed for specific uses. A customer who uses royalty-free sound effects, as opposed to hiring a sound engineer to create them from scratch, can save considerable time, effort, and money. Typically, podcasters and other content producers can obtain non-exclusive rights to a single effect, or they can purchase a subscription of sorts. The subscriptions allow publishers to download a limited number of sound effects during a specified period of time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

RSS significantly lowers the signal-to-noise ratio. RSS has the unique ability to compile information and filter it, so you only see unique and relevant content. The information superhighway has become packed with content, and those familiar with technology are using RSS to filter the content, allowing them to drill down and access only the content they want, without having to wade through all the noise. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Bookmarking Primer</title>
            <description>Social media is the Internet&apos;s version of viral messaging and marketing. Social media can be used to disseminate news or information, as well as to attract attention. There are a wide variety of social media channels and networks available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Social networks and social media websites are community-driven websites that allow visitors to submit items of interest. Visitors also decide what items appeal to them by voting or tagging; the more popular an item is determined to be by the visitors, the more exposure the item is given. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What Exactly is Podcasting?</title>
            <description>The term &lt;i&gt;podcast&lt;/i&gt; was initially used to reference an RSS feed that contained audio files in the items enclosure field. The meaning of podcasting has since expanded, and now refers to RSS feeds that contain all types of media, including audio and video, in the items enclosure field. For the non-technical folks, podcasting is simply a means of syndicating and distributing rich-media files via the Internet. The content contained in a podcast can vary significantly, from a song, to a educational lecture, to a political debate, to just about anything else. One great thing about podcasting is the wide variety of content formats it can contain. And unlike radio or television broadcasts, the recipient can listen or view at their leisure, choosing for themselves when and where they wish to listen or view a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feeds to Locate Jobs</title>
            <description>Monitor the job market using RSS Feeds. Using RSS Feeds To Locate Jobs!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to actually seeking a job, there are also other valid reasons to monitor the job market. Perhaps you are satisfied in your current position, but just want to keep an eye on new positions in a specific sector. Perhaps you are just curious to know what the wages are for similar positions. The job market can be monitored quite easily using RSS feeds. You can subscribe to RSS feeds in order to find specific company job openings, employment available within a specific region (i.e. by using a postal or zipcode), specific positions available, or to locate all jobs within a specific wage range. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Videocasting is simply distributing video content using RSS. The process is surprisingly simple, and by making video content available using RSS, videocasters give listeners more control over what they listen to and when. Also, many podcasts are available for syndication, which increases a broadcasters exposure.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Search Engine Optimization Resolutions for 2009</title>
            <description>Search engine optimization is a process, one that must always be revisited and adapted as search algorithms are changed by the search engines. Because SEO is a constant process, it is often pushed to the bottom of the &quot;to do list&quot; of marketers. Be that as it may, resolve not to ignore search engine optimization as it cycles its way through your task list. Give search engine optimization the attention that it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Bookmarking Tips</title>
            <description>Keep in mind that social websites vary and appeal to different audiences. Study the social website to determine the kinds of stories that attract the most attention and interest. If it were easy to predict what would be successful there would be a whole lot of rich people in the world. Determining what will or will not be successful in business is not an easy task, and the same is true for predicting what will be most effective when it comes to social bookmarking. &lt;br /&gt;

Templates can generally be edited and customized with any HTML editor. The biggest advantage for webmasters using ready-made templates is the amount of time that can be saved. There are a number of websites that provide ready-made HTML templates. We have compiled a list of some popular sites to make the search process easier. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Internet Marketing Resolutions</title>
            <description>Starting a New Year is all about self-reflecting. Most individuals celebrate the incoming year by looking back, determining what goals were met and what goals fell short. Most who have made past resolutions then look forward and resolve to do better in the coming year. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like any Internet marketer, I have a long laundry list of things that I intend to get to... invariably each year the list grows longer, and rarely do I make any significant headway on new projects, ideas, or marketing techniques. I resolve for that to change in 2008! I have compiled a list of Internet Marketing resolutions for the coming year. If your list is already too long, consider saving time and using the list below. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Technology in 2008</title>
            <description>The lens through which viewers receive their news has changed. The images of struggle are no longer frozen in time; technology has helped preserve and personalize these conflicts by producing moving tributes to the conflicts of humankind. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The strife and internal conflicts that marred the globe in 2006 continued into 2007: Mynamar (Burma), Palestine and Lebanon all continue to struggle with internal conflicts in their borders. The differences between 2006 and 2007 are not obvious; however, under close examination, it is evident that several external struggles have been transformed into internal conflicts. In 2006, many countries attempted to influence their neighbors. This was evident with Iran attempting to influence the turmoil in Iraq, and Syria attempting to control Lebanon. Both struggles have evolved into internal personal conflicts in 2007. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While video is not a new technology, the spread of video-viewing technology in devices like the iPod has brought the faces of terror into the homes of the western world. Advances in technology have also encouraged the West to open both their hearts and wallets, with many sponsoring children like Youseff, a child with a horribly scarred face. The same technology that brought Youssef&apos;s story to millions of homes, also helped bring tragedies like the Virginia Tech massacres. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2007, the heavy reliance on technology forced censorship and spying to the forefront of concerns. Many western countries accused the communist nation, China, of cyber snooping and hacking. Also, Russia did not remain unscathed in 2007, with widespread suspicion and accusations following the death of Alexander Litvinenko in late 2006. On a more positive note, North Korea seems to have complacently agreed to nuclear compliance. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

<b><i>Free Web Marketing Tips </i></b><br />
Not all web marketing needs to cost money. Aside from website submissions, there are a number of things that web marketers can do that are free, though they may be rather time-consuming.

<b><i>The Influence of Technology on Politics</i></b><br />
Americans have always had a say in their government, at least in theory. Since the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, the United States of America has been the <i>land of opportunity</i>, where even a lowly log-splitter, exercising sufficient brains and dedication, can raise himself to the highest executive office. <br />
<br />
The U.S. Constitution safeguards the right to vote for every citizen over eighteen years of age, with few exceptions, ensuring a government of the people, by the people and for the people. Nevertheless, only about half of eligible voters historically vote for their president. Those who do make it to the polls are more educated than unschooled, more white than black, more men than women, more wealthy than poor, and more old than young. <br />

&lt;br /&gt;
Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Syndicating Inventory</title>
            <description>While syndicating inventory is not a new concept, as it feeds for Amazon and eBay have been available for quite some time we are seeing more and more specialty houses offer RSS feeds for their stock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taking it a step further if RSS is not something your storefront currently offers consider using a script like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedforall.com/sql2rss.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;SQL2RSS&lt;/a&gt; to create an inventory feed. It will update realtime and show only what is available in the database.</description>

            <title>7 Day Software Highlights FeedForAll</title>
            <description>In the modern world of 2007 fewer and fewer people are building the XML representation of an RSS feed&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;by hand as most blogging and podcasting software now handles this function. However, if you&apos;re a software developer, want full control over your feed or you are doing something somewhat out-of-the-ordinary with RSS, as we do at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.projectglidepath.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;Project Glidepath&lt;/a&gt;, you need the tool we use, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedforall.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;FeedForAll&lt;/a&gt;, which creates, edits, uploads, downloads, and even error checks RSS data; a tremendous time saver.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Created by the folks at NotePage, Inc., a MicroISV based in Hannover, MA, FeedForAll, which is available for both Windows and Mac, is the&lt;b&gt; ultimate tool for hand-rolling RSS feeds&lt;/b&gt;. It gracefully handles all of the date-stamp issues (which is a *big* deal), understands all the iTunes XML idiosyncrasies as well as includes a WYSIWYG HTML editor you can use to edit the description fields and even has built-in image editing functions.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

&lt;i&gt;Feed publishers can use a type of application called a generator to create the RSS markup that makes your feed available. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedforall.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;FeedForAll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, for example, has a wizard that walks you through the creation of RSS feeds, whether you want to publish a plain RSS feed, a podcast feed, or a podcast with iTunes support. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Without the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time, that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for independent artists.

&lt;br /&gt;
With the use of technology, independent artists have a unique opportunity available, using technology they can significantly expand the exposure of their music.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Schools all over the country have flocked to podcasting as a new medium to assist the teaching profession. Professors are using podcasts to instruct students and get their messages out. Podcasting is not restricted to one educational sector, professors at prestigest colleges from Bentley to Purdue have flocked to this medium. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A growing number of professors are recording their lectures, the term coursecasting has been adopted in academia. Podcast lectures are used as study tools, and are available for students who might have missed class. Some podcasts are password restricted to students who are enrolled in that specific class. While other institution&apos;s publicly post their podcasts and offer non-enrolled students insight into the class material. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recordforall.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;RecordForAll&lt;/a&gt; was nominated for the 2007 SIA Award for the Best Sound Program or Utility! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.feedforall.com/07nominee.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siavoting.com/sia.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;Shareware Industry Awards&lt;/a&gt; were created as a way to honor the very best programs marketed using the &quot;shareware&quot; marketing model. In those early days it was often an up-hill battle, but the small software authors persevered. Over time, the number of companies using the &quot;shareware&quot; model has increased dramatically. Today nearly all software companies use the &quot;shareware&quot; marketing model whether they use the term or not. This fact stands as a tribute to the many pioneers who braved new ground in the name of &quot;shareware.&quot; These pages are a testimony to where we&apos;ve been, where we are, and just how far we&apos;ve come. The Shareware Industry Awards are dedicated to excellence in software.</description>

            <title>How to Conduct an Effective Podcast Interview</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Conducting a successful podcast interview can be a tricky proposition for a podcaster starting out. Once you have determined individuals that will appeal to your target audience contact potential interviewees and arrange a time to conduct the interview. Following this guide will insure that the interview goes off without a hitch. <br />
<br />
<b><i>1. Prepare Questions in Advance </i></b><br />
Prepare a list of questions prior to the interview, contemplate possible follow-up questions based on the expected responses. Create a list of notes along with the questions that are accessible during the interview and will help you direct the conversation. <br />
<br />
<b><i>2. Research Interview Subject</i></b><br />
Do your homework about the individual or individuals you are interviewing. A little due diligence will go a long way. Search newsgroups and Google for the interviewees name, product, or company, and build a background. The research will help predict the interviewees responses to your questions. Listen to previous interviews in which the interviewee participated, read their blog and articles to get a feel for the interviewees position on issues. <br />

                <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.smallbusinesscomputing.com/news/article.php/3672896" target="_blank">Small Business Computing</a> put together a great review on how to use <a href="http://www.feedforall.com" target="_blank">FeedForAll</a>.<br />
<br />
<i>FeedforAll is a wizard-driven solution can walk you through creating a standard RSS feed, a standard podcast, or an iTunes podcast. </i><br />
<br />
<i>The most technical information you will need to get started: your Web site server address and FTP server type. If you have your own in-house server hosting your Web site, you can get that information easily from your Web software (or better, from your IT guy). But more than likely, you are using an outside service provider to host your site, so you’ll need to get that info from them. </i><br />
<br />
<i>Before you panic, or spend time on hold waiting for tech support, drill down into the Web-hosting details area in your account-management screen, and you should be able to find the server address assigned to your site. Just be aware that some low-cost hosting subscriptions don’t provide FTP support (which you need to upload your feed), so you may need to upgrade your hosting account.</i><br />
<br />
<i>In FeedforAll, the first step in the RSS creation wizard is to give your feed a title. If there is (or will be) a Web page that will also contain the information provided in the RSS feed, use the same name. Then, you’ll be asked to fill in a description. This is a short summary that aptly describes the contents of the feed. You’ll also enter the link to the feed; that is, the Web page URL from which the RSS feed originates.</i>]]>

            <title>Where to Locate Podsafe Music</title>
            <description>Nothing really polishes a podcast more than background music or theme music. In the music world, these music segments are referred to as intros and extros. While many enjoy streaming Internet Audio and recording songs they like over the Internet, these songs cannot legally be used in a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PodSafe Music &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Podsafe music refers to music specifically for podcasters. The music is licensed in such a way that podcasters can purchase a license to include the music in a podcast without incurring additional fees or expenses. In order to use traditional music that is heard on the radio in a podcast, podcasters may have to pay royalties for each time the song is played. Some music files licensed under public domain or creative commons are exempt from royalties and these songs are available for use in a podcast, but generally when searching for music to include in a podcast it is probably best to stick with music that is specifically designated as &quot;podsafe&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Monetizing Podcasts</title>
            <description>Podcasts started out as fun ways for ambitious garage DJs, independent musicians and talk show hosts, who had not ventured into radio broadcasting as a way to show their stuff and make a name for themselves. What started as a hobby for many, has turned into a lucrative profession for some. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not surprisingly, podcasters, just like radio stations, have looked for ways to profit from their on-air dialogue. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Audio Recording Tips</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[When you are producing a podcast on a regular basis it is important that you select an appropriate location for the recording to take place. The location should be free of external distractions and relatively quiet. It is easiest if you use the same location each time, that way the equipment can remain in place and will not require moving or setup each time you produce a show. <br />
<br />
The room should have a carpet or furniture that will absorb echoes and dampen the sound. The room should also have a door, so that you will not have unexpected interruptions. Reduce extraneous noise by turning off fans or any equipment. Consider hanging a note on the door, so that you will not be disturbed while recording. <br />
<b><i></i></b><br />
<b><i>Recording Away from Home </i></b><br />
When taking your podcast on the road it is equally important that the quality of the podcast is not compromised for the sake of portability. Consider using a directional microphone or finding a quiet alcove for interviews when on the road. <br />

<b>What RSS Is Not; RSS Does Not Equal Email </b><br />
RSS is not email, nor is it designed to be a replacement for email. RSS is a supplemental communication channel that can be used to deliver content. Email newsletters have had an increasing problem with spam. Email open rates have plummeted, filtering systems have become increasingly complex and with the complexity and volume even "approved" messages have been unable to get through. <br />

<b>How to Get Ideas for RSS Feed and Blog Posts </b><br />
Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: <br />

<b>Why Niche RSS Feeds Matter? </b><br />
Just as the second generation of search engines and directories evolved into niche topic specific portals we are seeing the same occur in the area of RSS feed directories and search engines. While some directories are admittedly more niche than others the trend is obvious. <br />

            <title>Free RSS Auto Discovery Code Generator</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Increase the number of RSS subscribers by adding <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/autodiscovery.htm" target="_blank">autodiscovery code</a> to your website. NotePage has made a free online tool that automates the creation of the auto-discovery code for RSS feeds. <br />
<br />
The free auto-discovery tool automatically creates the code necessary for the auto-discovery of RSS feeds on a website. Simply enter the title, and the URL of the RSS feed and A code will then be generated based on the information entered. The code can then be entered in the "header" section of an HTML web page, to assist RSS readers in automatically detecting the precense of an RSS feed for that website. <br />
<br />
Many RSS Readers can automatically discover that an RSS feed is available for a specific website and notify the website visitor if the auto-discovery code is in place. Browsers and aggregators including FireFox, Safari and IE 7 are just a few applications that will take advanteage of the precense of RSS auto-discovery code. <br />
<br />
The RSS auto discovery tool can be accessed by clicking the following url <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/autodiscovery.htm" target="_blank">http://www.feedforall.com/autodiscovery.htm</a><br />]]>

            <title>Webmaster Tips</title>
            <description>According to Matt Cutts, there are over 100 factors that affect search engine ranking. For those of you who don&apos;t know, Matt is a Google guy guru, he is employed by Google but writes an independent blog and shares information related to Google and search engine optimization. Unfortunately, of those 100 items that account for search engine ranking, there are only a few that webmasters can actually control. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unless you are a interested in an exercise of futility, it is important to only focus on those ranking factors that you, as a webmaster, can control and influence. &lt;br /&gt;

<i>An RSS feed is an index of your website, your blog, or in my case: a video podcast. To post your podcasts to iTunes, you must supply an RSS feed in a certain format for the iTunes store to list your podcast properly. When you post new content to your site, the RSS feed must be updated. For most blogs, this is done automatically. For iTunes, one must do it manually. </i><br />

            <title>New Medical Feeds Directory</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.feedforall.com" target="_blank">FeedForAll</a> has sponsored a new <a href="http://www.medical-feeds.com" target="_blank">medical feeds directory</a>. <br>
<br>
As demand for RSS feeds grow, medical feeds continue to be one of the more popular content themes. In order to accommodate this demand, a new medical and health feed website directory has been created. As the demand for the medium increases, topical directories are the next step in helping searchers to connect with the medical information they are looking for. <br>
<br>
As RSS becomes more mainstream, finding specific medical feeds is becoming increasingly more difficult. A recent search for medical feeds in a popular search engine produced over one hundred and eighty million results. Narrowing the search to just diabetes feeds still came up with almost twenty million hits. Navigating through so many websites to find actual medical feeds is not only time consuming but also difficult. This is the reason that the medical feeds directory was created, to simplify the search process and connect users with medical and health feeds of interest. <br>
<br>
The website is dedicated to only medical and health feeds, making it easy to find RSS feeds on almost medical condition or disease. Users can search or use topic headings to locate the medical information that they are looking for. Hard to find items for obscure or unusual medical conditions are also available. The <a href="http://www.medical-feeds.com" target="_blank">medical-feeds.com</a> directory is a dynamic website that is constantly updating with the newest feed items. Allowing medical institutions s to add their feeds to the directory as they become available.<br>
<br>
The directory can be found at <a href="http://www.medical-feeds.com" target="_blank">http://www.medical-feeds.com</a>]]>

            <title>Free New Social Bookmark Chicklet Creator</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Social bookmarking has quickly become a popular way for frequent internet users to share their favorite websites with the public. Having a website added to a bookmark directory can increase traffic significantly. Bookmark chicklets are a newer creation that help remind those viewing a website to add it to the social bookmarking directories. It makes the bookmarking process easier for  who have found a website that is a good source of information or services. Another   of the tool is that the website description that goes into the bookmark is written into the script, allowing creators of the chicklet to choose how their website will be described in the directory. <br>

            <title>Learn How to Convert RSS to HTML</title>
            <description>Many webmasters have realized the benefit of using RSS to dynamically update websites. This means that the website content automatically changes when the RSS feed is updated. This allows for webmasters to serve dynamic content or a mixture of static and dynamic content on their website. &lt;br&gt;

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<i>Credibility online is becoming more and more of an issue. Anyone can have a blog or post to a forum and anyone can edit wiki entries. Web surfers are beginning to comprehend that just because it is in print does not necessarily mean that it is true. In fact, in today's online world, the collective truth might be the closest thing we can get to the real truth. Peer policing and social bookmarking have become common in the online world. </i><br>
<i></i><br>
<i>Human nature invariably prompts a level of trust;if it is written, it must be true. We live in a generation where we expect authors, editors and publishers that are qualified to write on various topics. What qualifications are required to post a blog, write an online article, or edit a wiki? Some web surfers may find the answer startling: None.</i><br>

            <title>iTunes New Categories</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Apple launched a revised set of categories for podcasts listed in the iTunes Music Store.<br>
<br>
<i>Most of the old categories and subcategories are now automatically mapped to corresponding ones within the new system. For example, if your podcast was listed under "Arts & Entertainment &gt; Photography", it will now appear under "Arts> Visual Arts." However, 3 categories have been removed and do not have a similar replacement: "International", "Talk Radio", and "Public Radio". Those categories overlapped with others in the old system, making some podcasts difficult to find. If one of these categories is listed as the first subject in your podcast feed, that category information will be ignored and the second category will be used to determine eligibility and placement in that feature page.</i><br>
<i></i><br>
<i>Changes to your categories may take 1-2 weeks from the time you edit your feed, so please review and add new category data as soon as possible to ensure your podcast is listed appropriately. New categories and subcategories that did not exist in the old browse structure will appear as podcasts are mapped to them.</i><br>

            <title>Tips to Promoting an RSS Feed</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you've made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed? <br>
<br>
 <b><i>1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. </i></b><br>
<i>This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile. A number of RSS search engines and RSS directories exist that allow you to freely submit RSS feeds. Feeds are generally categorized and grouped together by subject. Web surfers looking for RSS feeds about a specific subject will often search the RSS directories, to locate a feed that matches their specific criteria. Topic specific RSS feed and podcasting directories are also emerging. Choose a web feed's category carefully and only submit relevant feeds to topic specific directories. </i><br>
